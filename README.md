# xkcd Search
A simple one-page search that displays the latest xkcd comic, and uses cookies to see if the user has already seen the latest comic and show a random one.

Supports a crude-ish dark mode (inverts the usually-black-and-white comics) and change of default search engine, using a cookie to remember the previous choice.
